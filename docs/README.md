# Momentum

Momentum provides cross-platform APIs and interfaces to design, train, and implement neural networks in C++


Currently, at the early stages of development, the main focus is on "Make It Work", the documentation is not available, but the source code contains enough comments.

### Why develop a new framework?
* Despite being user-friendly for end-users, I found advanced frameworks like TensorFlow overwhelmingly complex from a developer point of view. Learning from its code-base about the implementation of neural networks is not an easy task.

* C++ is the implementation language of most advanced frameworks. But it is not a first-class citizen when it comes to end-user API.

* I needed a lightweight framework with minimal dependencies that is easily tweakable, and I could not find one the suites my needs, so I am developing one ;)

### How to intall, use, contribute ?

The project is at its early stages and it is not functional yet, so it is not possible to use it yet, also, if you have any suggestions, or are willing to contribute, you can contact me via email: fatehi.arash@gmail.com
